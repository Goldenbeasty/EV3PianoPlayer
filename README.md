# EV3PianoPlayer
Code made to run on a EV3 robot running microPython to play a piano


Sample sweden.mp3 is playing what the robot should play on a piano

The code in main.py should play Sweden by C418 but on only four keys. 
The leftmost key is F4. To make my code work I had to modify the track a lot.
The build is simular to as shown in this video, where the inspiration for this project came from: https://youtu.be/TDvcTa3abRM

I will try to put up some pictures, but Im not sure when I am able to do that.
